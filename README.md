## Getting started

This is a basic VueJs, Vuetify, Vue Router and Vuex skeleton written on JavaScript.

## Features

-   Vuetify
-   Multiple environment ready (development, production).
-   Vue router
-   Vuex
-   i18n ready.
-   Ready to add to home screen in iOS and Chrome, checks if there´s an app update every 2 hours and reloads page (When a web app is added as stand alone there´s no reload button in the browser so new .js files from a new build never get loaded)
-   Login.
-   Users admin area with CRUD operations.

## Demo
